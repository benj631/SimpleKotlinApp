# Overview

This is a simple Kotlin-based android application that has 3 simple screens, a home, a text editor, and a submit button.
I wanted to make this because I've been interested in application development, so it's been fun to have something that works.

[Here is a video demonstration of the project](https://youtu.be/cSPX4INIXPI)

# Development Environment

The project uses Kotlin with Android studio, and XML layouts.

# Useful Websites

Various tutorials for Julia were helpful, but I focused on:

- ChatGPT was very useful for the project, but I did have to understand what the code was doing in order to do this.

# Future Work

I learned a lot about app development, and understanding how Android studio works. Future work would include:

- Work on being able to save and reload text from storage
- Not losing information when switching screens
- Creating a robust menu system
